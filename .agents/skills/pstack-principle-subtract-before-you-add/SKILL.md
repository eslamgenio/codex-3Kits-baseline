## Codex adapter

Read [../../CODEX-COMPATIBILITY.md](../../CODEX-COMPATIBILITY.md) before executing this workflow. Resolve family-local skill names through the catalog; use only tools exposed in this session. This adapter and the project's AGENTS.md govern host-specific operations in the upstream workflow.

# Subtract Before You Add

When evolving a system, remove complexity first, then build. Default to subtraction.

Make simplification a continual investment. Leave the design slightly simpler and more capable behind the same or smaller surface than you found it.

- Sequence removal before construction
- Cut before you polish (get to the minimum before investing in quality)
- Design for observed usage, not speculative edge cases
- No speculative validators, parsers, or guards beyond what the spec demands
- Simplify prompts (remove redundant instructions, excessive templates)
- When a reference has no novel content, delete it rather than leaving a stub
