description: Set up Claude Code hooks to block dangerous git commands (push, reset
  --hard, clean, branch -D, etc.) before they execute. Use when user wants to prevent
  destructive git operations, add git safety hooks, or block git push/reset in Claude
  Code.

## Codex adapter

Read [../../CODEX-COMPATIBILITY.md](../../CODEX-COMPATIBILITY.md) before executing this workflow. Resolve family-local skill names through the catalog; use only tools exposed in this session. This adapter and the project's AGENTS.md govern host-specific operations in the upstream workflow.

### Capability and behavior adjustment

Claude hook integration only. Under Codex, provide an applicability assessment and explain that Claude PreToolUse hooks do not enforce Codex permissions. Install Claude hooks only for an explicitly requested Claude target. Codex enforcement requires separately supported sandbox/approval controls; this skill cannot claim to install equivalent Codex hooks.

# Setup Git Guardrails

Sets up a PreToolUse hook that intercepts and blocks dangerous git commands before Claude executes them.

## What Gets Blocked

- `git push` (all variants including `--force`)
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -f` / `git clean -fd`
- `git branch -D`
- `git checkout .` / `git restore .`

When blocked, Claude sees a message telling it that it does not have authority to access these commands.

## Steps

### 1. Ask scope

Ask the user: install for **this project only** (`.claude/settings.json`) or **all projects** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)?

### 2. Copy the hook script

The bundled script is at: [scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh](scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh)

Copy it to the target location based on scope:

- **Project**: `.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`
- **Global**: `~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh`

Make it executable with `chmod +x`.

### 3. Add hook to settings

Add to the appropriate settings file:

**Project** (`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Global** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/block-dangerous-git.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the settings file already exists, merge the hook into the existing `hooks.PreToolUse` array. Don't overwrite other settings.

### 4. Ask about customization

Ask if user wants to add or remove any patterns from the blocked list. Edit the copied script accordingly.

### 5. Verify

Run a quick test:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git push origin main"}}' | <path-to-script>
```

Should exit with code 2 and print a BLOCKED message to stderr.
